**Prime Game Outline:**

**Objective:** Create a simple console-based Prime Number guessing game where players take turns guessing prime numbers.

**Steps to Create a Prime Game:**

1. **Setup the Game:**
   - Create a Python script, e.g., `prime_game.py`.
   - Import any necessary libraries.

2. **Define Game Rules:**
   - Decide on the number of rounds (how many turns each player will have).
   - Determine how players earn points (e.g., by correctly guessing prime numbers).

3. **Create Functions:**
   - Write functions to:
     - Check if a number is prime.
     - Generate a random prime number for each round.
     - Keep track of players' scores.

4. **Main Game Loop:**
   - Implement the main game loop.
   - In each round:
     - Generate a random prime number.
     - Ask the current player to guess if it's prime or not.
     - Check their guess and update their score accordingly.

5. **Display Results:**
   - After all rounds are played, display the final scores.
   - Declare the winner (player with the most points).

6. **Play Again Option:**
   - Ask if the players want to play another round.
   - If yes, repeat the game loop; if no, exit the game.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected errors.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Create a `README.md` file with instructions on how to play the game.
   - Explain the rules and how to run the Python script.

9. **Testing:**
   - Test the game thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

10. **Optional Enhancements:**
    - Add more features like difficulty levels, a timer for guessing, or a graphical user interface (GUI).

Once you've followed these steps and created your Prime Game, you can write a `README.md` file, as shown in the previous response, to document your project and provide instructions for players.

Remember to customize the game to your preferences and add any unique features you'd like to include in your Prime Game.








# Prime Game

Prime Game is a simple Python console-based game where two players take turns to guess prime numbers. The game is designed to test your knowledge of prime numbers and basic Python programming skills.

## How to Play

1. Run the `prime_game.py` script in your Python environment.
   ```
   python prime_game.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.

3. Players take turns to enter a number. The game will determine whether the number is prime or not.

4. If the number is prime, the player earns a point. Otherwise, the other player gets a chance.

5. The game continues until a predefined number of rounds or until you decide to exit.

6. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Features

- Fun and educational game to test your prime number knowledge.
- Two-player mode for competitive gameplay.
- Keeps track of scores and displays the winner at the end.
- Customizable number of rounds for each game session.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the game script:
   ```
   python prime_game.py
   ```

## Configuration

You can customize the following settings in the `prime_game.py` script:

- `NUM_ROUNDS`: Set the number of rounds for each game session.
- `MAX_NUMBER`: Set the maximum number to consider when checking for prime numbers.
- `PLAYER_1_NAME` and `PLAYER_2_NAME`: Customize the player names.
