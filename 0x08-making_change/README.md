If you want to simulate changing the probability outcomes of coin flips in Python, you can use the `random` module to generate random numbers and create your custom probability distribution. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:

Let's say you want to create a biased coin that has a higher probability of landing on heads (H) than tails (T). You can adjust the probabilities of each outcome accordingly.

```python
import random

def biased_coin_flip(probability_heads):
    if random.random() < probability_heads:
        return "H"
    else:
        return "T"

# Adjust the probability as desired (e.g., 0.7 for 70% heads)
probability_heads = 0.7

num_flips = 10  # Number of coin flips
for _ in range(num_flips):
    outcome = biased_coin_flip(probability_heads)
    print(outcome, end=" ")
```

In this example, the `biased_coin_flip` function takes a probability value for heads and returns either "H" or "T" based on that probability. If a random number between 0 and 1 is less than the given probability, it returns "H"; otherwise, it returns "T".

You can modify the `probability_heads` value to simulate different biases in the coin's outcomes. Just keep in mind that this is a simple simulation and actual outcomes might deviate due to randomness.

Remember that in a real-world scenario, you can't change the intrinsic probability of a physical coin, but you can simulate different outcomes using the methods described above.
