# Log Parsing in Python

This repository provides a Python script for parsing log files. It is a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to extract meaningful information from log files and perform analysis on the log data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use the log parsing script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you are ready to use the log parsing script.

## Usage

The log parsing script is located in the `log_parser.py` file. Before running the script, make sure you have a log file that you want to parse. The log file should be in plain text format.

To run the script, use the following command:
```
python log_parser.py <log_file_path> <output_file_path>
```

Replace `<log_file_path>` with the path to your log file, and `<output_file_path>` with the desired path for the output file. The output file will contain the parsed log data.

## Customization

The script can be customized to extract specific information from your log files. By default, it reads the entire log file and writes the parsed data to an output file.

You can modify the script according to your needs. For example, you can define regular expressions or specific patterns to extract particular log entries or filter out irrelevant information. Additionally, you can perform data analysis, generate statistics, or visualize the parsed log data.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using the log parsing script:

- Parse a log file and save the parsed data to an output file:
  ```
  python log_parser.py /path/to/log_file.txt /path/to/output_file.txt
  ```

- Parse a log file and print the parsed data to the console:
  ```
  python log_parser.py /path/to/log_file.txt -
  ```
